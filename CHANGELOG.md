## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- In-process dryness watchdog: if `relay.seconds_since_last_rtp` exceeds
  `MAMMOTION_DRY_RESTART_SECONDS` (default `180`), the bridge tears the
  whole session down (relay, RTSP server, pymammotion client) and
  re-bootstraps from a fresh cloud login inside the same process. Closes
  the "stuck for hours, only `docker restart` fixes it" failure mode that
  the in-relay reconnect loop could not escape because cred-refresh on a
  stale pymammotion/MQTT session no longer wakes the mower.

### Changed
- `main()` refactored into an outer retry loop plus a new
  `_run_bridge_session()` inner function. All resources allocated in a
  session are released in its `finally` block before the watchdog
  exception propagates, so the in-process restart never leaks the
  upstream PC, RTSP listener, or cloud client. No `sys.exit` / `os._exit`
   — recovery works regardless of the container's restart policy.
- `AgoraToRtspRelay._last_rtp_ns` now initialised to `monotonic_ns()` at
  construction (was `0`) so a bootstrap that never produces video also
  ages out, and a public `seconds_since_last_rtp` property exposes the
  age in seconds for the bridge-level watchdog to consume.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Split the relay supervisor's backoff into two regimes based on whether
  any H265 RTP packet arrived during the cycle:
  - **Publisher stall** (we had RTP, then it stopped) — always retry at the
    immediate `reconnect_backoff_seconds` (1 s). Sub-15 s recovery preserved.
  - **Mower offline** (no RTP this cycle — Agora signaling timeouts,
    "device not responding" from cloud, no `on_user_online`, etc.) —
    exponential ramp up to `max_reconnect_backoff_seconds`. We don't burn
    the pymammotion 300/24h MQTT budget hammering a sleeping mower.
- Raised `max_reconnect_backoff_seconds` from 10 s back to 60 s. The cap
  is now only relevant for the offline path; stalls always use 1 s, so
  this no longer slows down legitimate recovery.

### Added
- New log lines that explicitly distinguish the two failure modes:
  - `INFO  Publisher stalled mid-stream; retrying in 1.0s`
  - `WARNING Mower appears offline (no video received this cycle); backing off 4.0s (next attempt's backoff: 8.0s)`

### Why
v0.1.8's tuning made stall recovery fast, but the same fast path was also
used when the mower itself was offline — burning MQTT budget and stack-
tracing every cycle without any hope of recovery. The phone app is
genuinely unreachable in the same scenarios; sustained Agora hammering
doesn't make our bridge more capable than the official app.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- **Aggressive recovery defaults out of the box.** The previous defaults
  (30 s watchdog, 10 s cheap-recovery wait, 5 s reconnect backoff) made
  stall recovery take ~47 s with no env-var tuning. Re-baselined so a
  default-config bridge recovers in ~11 s:
  - `MAMMOTION_NO_RTP_WATCHDOG_SECONDS`: `30` → `5`
  - `MAMMOTION_CHEAP_RECOVERY_WAIT_SECONDS`: `10` → `3`
  - Relay `reconnect_backoff_seconds`: `5.0` → `1.0` (internal, not env-tunable)
  - Relay `max_reconnect_backoff_seconds`: `60.0` → `10.0` (internal)
- Demoted `agora_edge` `Generated answer SDP` log from INFO to DEBUG.
  Every Agora reconnect was dumping ~50 SDP lines into the log; with the
  more aggressive recovery defaults that's a lot of noise. Re-enable with
  `MAMMOTION_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.

### Why
With v0.1.7's proactive PLI eliminating the GOP wait, the dominant
remaining freeze contributor was the watchdog / cheap-recovery / backoff
defaults — all generous holdovers from earlier debugging. The new
defaults are tuned for "10 fps H265 stream, want sub-15 s gaps."

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Proactive PLI when the first H265 RTP packet of a new upstream session
  arrives. The mower is typically mid-GOP at that moment and the first
  packets we receive are P-frames — which carry no parameter sets, so
  RTSP `DESCRIBE` blocks waiting for VPS/SPS/PPS and go2rtc times out at
  5 s. Firing one PLI as soon as we know the publisher's SSRC pushes the
  mower onto a fresh IDR (which prepends parameter sets), so DESCRIBE
  completes in ~1 s instead of ~6 s (next natural GOP boundary).

  Cuts black-screen time after every reconnect — token expiry, no-RTP
  watchdog fire, network blip, etc. Most visible at startup and after
  any of v0.1.6's cheap-recovery escalations.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Wire pymammotion's `refresh_fpv` (`MulSetEncode(encode=True)`) in as the
  camera-specific keep-alive. Three integration points:
  - `wake_publisher` now sends `refresh_fpv` after the
    `device_agora_join_channel_with_position`, so every upstream reconnect
    explicitly re-enables the encoder.
  - The periodic keep-alive loop calls `refresh_fpv` instead of the generic
    `send_todev_ble_sync sync_type=2` (which only kept the cloud session
    warm and didn't touch the encoder). Falls back to the old command if
    pymammotion is too old to expose `refresh_fpv`.
  - The no-RTP watchdog now tries `refresh_fpv` first as a cheap recovery
    (`MAMMOTION_CHEAP_RECOVERY_WAIT_SECONDS`, default 10 s) and only
    escalates to full teardown + reconnect if RTP doesn't resume. This
    eliminates most of the reconnect churn that was burning the MQTT budget.

### Why
`send_todev_ble_sync sync_type=2` is a generic Aliyun MQTT heartbeat, not
a camera command. The mower's multimedia SoC was going idle even while we
were sending those pings. `refresh_fpv` targets the actual encoder.
Surfaced by reading Mikey's recent pymammotion additions
([`pymammotion/mammotion/commands/messages/video.py:48`](pymammotion/mammotion/commands/messages/video.py#L48)).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Drop the early-SDP fallback in `agora_edge` that fired on
  `on_add_video_stream` timeout. The fallback built an answer SDP without the
  publisher's actual SSRC/PT, which silently broke codec routing in the
  aiortc receiver (`codecs_by_pt` lookup misses → RTP tap drops every
  packet → watchdog fires → reconnect → same timeout → infinite loop).
  Raising on timeout instead lets the supervisor back off and retry cleanly.
- Re-tag `:stable` to the actual newest code. After the v0.1.2/3/4 history
  rewrite, parallel CI builds for all three retagged versions raced for the
  `:stable` floating tag and v0.1.2 (WHEP bridge code) won, leaving `:stable`
  serving the old WHEP signaling bridge. v0.1.5 is unambiguously the newest
  tag so CI publishes the aiortc relay code as `:stable`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- No-RTP watchdog (`MAMMOTION_NO_RTP_WATCHDOG_SECONDS`, default 30 s). If the
  upstream ICE/DTLS session stays "connected" but no H265 RTP packet arrives
  for the configured window, the bridge tears down the upstream and lets the
  supervisor reconnect — which refetches credentials and re-triggers the
  mower to publish. Fixes the silent-stall mode where the publisher would
  back off after a few minutes and the bridge would happily sit on a dead
  session until the hourly token expiry forced a reconnect.

### Changed
- `MAMMOTION_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS` default raised from 10 s to 300 s. The old
  cadence sent ~8640 MQTT messages per day; pymammotion's Aliyun MQTT
  transport self-imposes a ~300/24 h cap, so the bridge would hit the limit
  ~50 min in and then silently stop nudging the mower. 5 min cadence keeps
  the bridge well under the cap and the no-RTP watchdog handles the case
  where the publisher times out anyway.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **Replaced the architecture.** The bridge is now an aiortc-based passive
  WebRTC subscriber that taps Agora's H265 RTP packets and republishes them
  byte-for-byte from an embedded RTSP server. No ffmpeg, no transcoding, no
  WHEP/WS signaling step — Frigate's go2rtc consumes the bridge with a plain
  `rtsp://` source. See the rewritten README for the rationale.
- Default (and only) entrypoint is `mammotion_webrtc_bridge.py`. Image no
  longer needs `BRIDGE_SCRIPT` to select the relay.

### Removed
- Legacy ffmpeg transcode bridge (`mammotion_go2rtc_bridge.py`) — the new
  passthrough path supersedes it.
- WebRTC signaling passthrough mode (WHEP/WS) — Pion's interop with Agora's
  edge is unreliable (`p2p_lost: Timeout` ~10 s into every session), so this
  path is effectively unusable for Mammotion and has been removed.
- `ffmpeg` apt package, the `docker-entrypoint.sh` wrapper, and the
  `MAMMOTION_GO2RTC_SIGNALING` / `MAMMOTION_WHEP_*` env vars.
- Stale `DESIGN-webrtc-passthrough.md` design notes.

### Added
- aiortc H265 patch (`mammotion_webrtc/h265_patch.py`) — registers H265 with
  aiortc as opaque RTP so the SDP/codec-routing/decoder-spawn paths accept it
  without a native H265 decoder dependency.
- Minimal asyncio RTSP server (`mammotion_webrtc/rtsp_server.py`) with
  TCP-interleaved transport, parameter-set-aware SDP, and per-session queue
  back-pressure.
- Single combined `docker-compose.example.yml` modelled on a real working
  Frigate + bridge setup.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Experimental Mammotion -> go2rtc WebRTC passthrough bridge (`mammotion_webrtc_bridge.py`) and standalone signaling server (`mammotion_webrtc/whep_server.py`) for direct Agora edge negotiation.
- go2rtc-native WebSocket signaling endpoint (`/api/ws?src=...`) as an alternative to one-shot WHEP client mode.
- Runtime signaling mode switch with `MAMMOTION_GO2RTC_SIGNALING` (`http` or `ws`).
- Periodic stream-registration reconciliation (`MAMMOTION_GO2RTC_RECONCILE_SECONDS`) to auto-recover registration after go2rtc/Frigate restarts.
- Dedicated passthrough example compose file and docs updates.

### Changed
- SDP answer generation now includes a Pion/go2rtc compatibility profile for better interop with Frigate-bundled go2rtc.
- WebRTC passthrough now enforces go2rtc-native WS signaling; WHEP mode is treated as unsupported for Frigate/go2rtc.

### Fixed
- Improved reconnect behavior when closing/reopening a viewer by handling trickle ICE candidates throughout the WS session lifecycle.
- Added explicit WHEP client logging for easier diagnostics of active compatibility mode.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-27

First public release. Experimental.

### Added
- Bridge that subscribes to a Mammotion mower's Agora video and publishes it to
  go2rtc over RTSP, transcoded to a steady 10 fps H.264 stream.
- Automatic recovery from the mower leaving the Agora channel (~50 s cycle):
  proactive 20 s keep-alive plus reactive wake-up.
- Fresh cloud login per cycle so an expired session token can't wedge the bridge.
- Watchdogs: startup-frame timeout, frame-stall, publisher-gone-too-long, and an
  ffmpeg subprocess health check with auto-restart.
- Docker healthcheck driven by a frame-ingress heartbeat file (defaults to
  `/tmp/mammotion_heartbeat`).
- Multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) published to GHCR with `:latest`, `:stable`,
  and semver tags via GitHub Actions.
- Example configs for Frigate and standalone go2rtc, plus a documented HA
  advanced-camera-card snippet.
