## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-27

First public release. Experimental.

### Added
- Bridge that subscribes to a Mammotion mower's Agora video and publishes it to
  go2rtc over RTSP, transcoded to a steady 10 fps H.264 stream.
- Automatic recovery from the mower leaving the Agora channel (~50 s cycle):
  proactive 20 s keep-alive plus reactive wake-up.
- Fresh cloud login per cycle so an expired session token can't wedge the bridge.
- Watchdogs: startup-frame timeout, frame-stall, publisher-gone-too-long, and an
  ffmpeg subprocess health check with auto-restart.
- Docker healthcheck driven by a frame-ingress heartbeat file (defaults to
  `/tmp/mammotion_heartbeat`).
- Multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) published to GHCR with `:latest`, `:stable`,
  and semver tags via GitHub Actions.
- Example configs for Frigate and standalone go2rtc, plus a documented HA
  advanced-camera-card snippet.
