"""Agora → RTSP H265 passthrough relay.

Owns one upstream aiortc ``RTCPeerConnection`` that subscribes to the
mower's Agora channel as a passive viewer, and forwards every received
H265 RTP packet to an embedded :class:`Go2RtcRtspStream` that go2rtc
consumes via ``rtsp://``. Path:

    Mower → Agora SFU → aiortc upstream PC → RTP tap → RTSP → go2rtc

The aiortc codec stack is monkey-patched in :mod:`.h265_patch` so the SDP
offer/answer can carry H265 PT 100 and the receiver does not drop packets
or crash its decoder thread. Once the patches are in place aiortc is happy
to ferry the H265 bytes through SRTP and out the other side; we never
decode anything.

Lifecycle:

* Eager start: ``await start()`` kicks off the supervisor task. Frigate is
  always-on, so a lazy/idle-grace teardown adds no value and risks the
  upstream not being ready when the first viewer asks.
* Self-healing: the supervisor reconnects on upstream failure with a
  bounded backoff. Each retry refetches credentials via the provider so
  expired Agora tokens are handled implicitly.
* ``await stop()`` tears down both the PC and the RTSP server cleanly.
